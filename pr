I hope this message finds you well. As my current contract is set to conclude in two months, I wanted to inquire about potential opportunities moving forward. I understand that this may be early to ask, but I would appreciate it if you could let me know if there are any plans for Phase II or any other work that may follow. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
