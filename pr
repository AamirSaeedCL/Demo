Req.

Acceptance Criteria

1 – remove “PreviousStatusActive” field

Given the customerTags associated data items have been updated to incorporate the new changes

When I view the customerTag table within the PegaDataMart

Then I will not see the “PreviousStatusActive” field

And this field will also be removed from the Customer-tags.json 

And this field will also be removed from the Customer data model within Pega

 

2 – Rename all customerTags to include “Tag” in field

Given the customerTags associated data items have been updated to incorporate the new changes

When I view the customerTags table within the PegaDataMart

Then I will see all fields defined in table 1 have been renamed to that of the “To Be” column

And these updates will also be applied to the Customer-tags.json 

And this update will also be applied to the Customer data model within Pega

 

3 – Update bit data types to not allow for nulls

Given CustomerTags associated data items where datatype = bit have been updated to not allow for nulls

When the CustomerTag pipeline is run within the PegaDataMart (incremental or Initial)

Then the following fields will only return a 1 or 0:

ddTagActive
dialTagActive 
digitalTagActive
payerPhaseTagActive
phaseTagActive
planTagActive
preDefTagActive
remediationTagActive 
smsTagActive 
statusTagActive 
And if the data at source is null/empty

Then this will be converted to a 0 when syncing the data to the CustomerTags table

And when the customer-tags.json is generated

Then any of the above fields = 1 will be converted to “True”

And any of the above fields = 0 will be converted to “False”

And this will be ingested into Pega accordingly

 

4 – Update all data items to CamelCase

Given all data items within the customer-tags json file have bee updated to CamelCase

When I view the customer-tags.json file

Then I will see all data items populated in CamelCase format

         “customerID",

        "isActive”

         “ddTag",

        "dateDDTagAssigned",
