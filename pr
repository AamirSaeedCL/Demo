Hi Service Desk,

Could you please raise a ticket and assign it to Steve Dowie?

Details:
As discussed with Steve, we need a script to manage the tumble windows triggers (currently running every 5 minutes). The requirement is to have a script that developers can run through the release pipeline to start and stop triggers, because developers currently do not have permissions to:

Run PowerShell scripts directly

Make changes in the master branch

Requirements for the script:

The script should handle all existing triggers with names starting with:
Pipeline_Scheduler_Realtime_%%%

Ability to start and stop all running instances

Suggested script file names:

RealTime_StartTriggers.ps1

RealTime_StopTriggers.ps1

Reference:
We already have something similar available here:
DataFactory-StartTrigger.ps1

Please let me know once the ticket is raised and assigned.

Thank you,
