I have made the following updates on the SQL side:

The columns DateDDTagAssigned, DateDDTagRemoved, and DDTagActive have been renamed to DateDDAssigned, DateDDRemoved, and DDActive, respectively.
This change removes the redundant “Tag” keyword to maintain consistency with the naming convention used for other tag-related fields.

Similarly, the column DateStatusActive has been renamed to StatusActive for the same reason.
