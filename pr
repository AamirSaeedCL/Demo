I have gone thorugh this ticket in detail and it seems you are not testing against our acceptance criteria.
If you go to the parent PBI (https://cabotcm.visualstudio.com/BEST/_workitems/edit/211125) and open the "New Data Items" excel sheet from the attachment files section.
You will see that we have columns mapping "daysTillCurrentPlanEndDate" for column against below query.


SELECT sps.cnsmr_id
		, DATEDIFF (DD,CAST (GETDATE() AS DATE),CAST (schdld_pymnt_smmry_end_dttm AS DATE)) AS daysTillCurrentPlanEndDate
		, sps.schdld_pymnt_smmry_end_dttm AS PaymentPlanEndDate	
	FROM crs5_oltp_replicated.dbo.schdld_pymnt_smmry sps
	WHERE sps.schdld_pymnt_smmry_stts_cd = 9

we need to check the `schdld_pymnt_smmry_stts_cd==9` which I beleive is "Active" and now we as soon as we have schdld_pymnt_smmry_stts_cd=9 against the same "customerId= 253905"
you can see that we have "DaysTilleCurrentPlanEndDate=85" in Paymentplan table in PegaDataMart database. I'm attacheding the screenshots for your reference.
