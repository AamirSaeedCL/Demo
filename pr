I have tested this against two to three instances of the customer pipeline, and it appears to be functioning as expected. Below is one of the test cases for your review.

Upon further investigation, the issue seems to occur when the customer pipeline is already running via a trigger or scheduled execution (i.e., in real time), and we manually click "Debug" or "Start" to initiate the pipeline again. This overlapping execution appears to be causing the observed behavior.

In a normal execution scenario—whether the pipeline completes successfully or encounters an error—we are logging the EndDateTime as expected. This issue arises specifically in cases of concurrent manual and automated executions.
