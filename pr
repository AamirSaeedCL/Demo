Implement Build Pipeline for NuGet Package Creation:

Set up a build pipeline in Azure DevOps, modeled after the existing Mist.Core-Build pipeline? This pipeline should be configured to create a NuGet package intended for use within our Azure Functions.

For reference, you can access the current build pipeline configuration here: Mist.Core-Build - Azure DevOps Services.

Please ensure that the new pipeline adheres to our standard practices and is properly integrated into our CI/CD workflow. 










implement a build pipeline


Please implement a build pipeline by referencing the following build definition:
https://cabotcm.visualstudio.com/Cabot%20Api/_apps/hub/ms.vss-ciworkflow.build-ci-hub?_a=edit-build-definition&id=305

Once the build pipeline is successfully established, the generated artifact needs to be integrated into the specified release pipeline. Additionally, kindly re-enable the 'Deploy DacPac' step within the release process:
https://cabotcm.visualstudio.com/Shared%20Services/_release?_a=releases&view=all&definitionId=105
