Team,

We did not have any data in the DATES table in both the Dev and SIT environments, which is why the isBankHoliday status was not being set to true.

To address this, I copied the required data from the WH server into both Dev and SIT environments. I then tested the functionality using the following dates:

2025-04-01

2025-04-18 (Bank Holiday)

2025-05-05 (Bank Holiday)

2025-05-06 (Bank Holiday)

After running the customer pipeline, the status updated correctly as expected, confirming that the issue is now resolved.
