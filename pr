Firstly, I apologize for not being able to share this on the MS Teams channel, as it appears my OneDrive has not been set up yet.

Please find attached the Azure Data Factory (ADF) architecture diagram files for your reference. I am providing both the source file and the PDF version. I used https://app.diagrams.net to create the diagram.

At a high level, the diagram encompasses several key components, including data sources, data ingestion methods, data storage, data processing, and data movement. Most of the elements are self-explanatory.
