Check Access Control List (ACLs) on the file/folder in ADLS. You can use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to check and set permissions.
The Storage Blob Data Reader or Storage Blob Data Contributor role at the container or file system level should be granted to the service principal or managed identity that Databricks uses.


ensure that the Databricks cluster has the correct Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication enabled.
Verify that the Databricks workspace is configured with the correct managed identity or service principal and that it has access to the Azure Data Lake Storage.
