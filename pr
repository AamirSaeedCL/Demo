Hi Team,

As per the current implementation, the PlanTypeDescription is being retrieved from the UDEFPAYMENT_PLAN_LETTER_VARS table for the corresponding customer.

SELECT 
    cnsmr_id, 
    UDEFPLAN_TYPE AS PlanTypeDescription
FROM crs5_oltp.dbo.UDEFPAYMENT_PLAN_LETTER_VARS WITH (NOLOCK)
WHERE UDEFPLAN_TYPE IS NOT NULL


However, for the current customer, there is no corresponding record available in this table. As a result, the query returns NULL, which is why the PlanTypeDescription is not being populated.

To address this scenario, I have introduced additional logic such that when the above query does not return a value (i.e., PlanTypeDescription is NULL for the given customerId), the system will instead retrieve a default value from the lookup table:

Ref_schdld_pymnt_typ_cd.schdld_pymnt_typ_dscrptn_txt


Please confirm if this approach is acceptable so that I can proceed with raising a Pull Request.
