Firstly, I apologize for not bringing this up sooner. On Tuesday morning, I encountered an issue with my VPN as it wasnâ€™t recognizing my user registration, which gave me about an hour and a half of unexpected downtime. During that time, I worked on creating a PR template.

The implementation of a PR template is essential for maintaining consistency across our pull requests, streamlining the review process, and enhancing accountability and transparency within our workflow. I would appreciate it if you could review the template and provide any feedback or suggest modifications.
