Hi India,

One point I would like to highlight: as you may recall, we removed the trigger for the existing incremental pipeline Customer Tag (without “S”), as it was no longer required.

However, for the new incremental pipeline Customer Tags (with “S”), I believe a trigger should be configured, and it currently appears to be missing.

Could you please discuss this with Mark to obtain his review and approval, and then raise a ticket accordingly if he agrees?

Thank you.
