From previous experience, if we need to run the initial ingestion (Customer) pipeline in the SIT or higher environments, we should first rename the existing dbo.Customer table to dbo.Customer1 as a temporary backup. After that, we can execute the initial ingestion process. This approach allows us to quickly restore the customer data if Pega or the testing team needs it.
