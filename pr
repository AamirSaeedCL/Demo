I have tested against two/three instances of Customer pipeline - It seems working fine. Here is one of the case for your review.

In fact, What is happending, when customer pipeline is running through trigger/schedule (real time) and we then click the debug/start the pipeline manually again then it is causing that case. I normal running case - It should end with scusessfull or error and in both casees we are logging the enddatetime.
