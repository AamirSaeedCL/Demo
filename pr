Meeting Agenda: Ghost Trigger Issue in DEV (CustomerTags)
1. Background & Issue Overview

Overview of the ghost trigger (CustomerTags) running in DEV

Impact: Trigger is clearing the STG table

Observed behaviour:

Trigger was disabled

Trigger was deleted

Pipeline was renamed

Yet the trigger is still firing

2. Investigation Findings

Review of current trigger state in Azure Data Factory

Discussion on possible causes of a “ghost” / orphaned trigger instance

Confirmation of any running trigger instances still active in DEV

3. Existing PowerShell Script Review

Review of existing script: Datafactory-RemoveTrigger.ps1

What it currently does:

Iterates through all triggers

Disables running triggers

Deletes triggers (not desired behaviour)

Why this script cannot be reused as-is

4. Proposed Solution

Create a new PowerShell script that:

Iterates through all triggers

Stops / deactivates only running triggers

Does NOT delete triggers

Ensure script is safe and idempotent

5. Release Pipeline Changes

Create a DEV-only release pipeline

Purpose:

Execute the new PowerShell script

Handle and prevent ghost trigger issues in DEV
