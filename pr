Hi Team,Fyi, Re-Customer tags (Initial ingestion) pipeline, I've tried to do it thorugh Copy activity but got an error (timeout) after 2 hours, which is the default settings in copy activity - I've then increased it to 12 hours but still got an error (log file full etc) also it seems query got struck etc.
I still remember that customer tags pipeline in MLP1 was nightmare. What I have done, I've created a new child pipeline and split the master query in to different parts (based on tag types) - We can easily do it as we have hardcoded column names against each tag type in our table as you know.
So, I end up following, first I load the 'PlanStat' tags rows as  as records it has more records then any other tag types and insert it bluk - then after that one by one load the other tags types thorugh upsert.
I have matched the total rows and they are matching with DM.
--Id  Tag-Type       Total Rows 
--92	PlanStat  ----> 1,497,709  (Bulk insert,)

--123	DIGITAL  ----> 17 (upsert)
