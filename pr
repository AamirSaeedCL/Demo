Sorry, but this is quite confusing as the PBI description is not clearly defined. Could you please provide a simple breakdown of the total number of new columns that need to be added, along with each new column name (source), the corresponding target column, and the mapping query?

In all previous PBIs, an Excel sheet was provided that listed the new column names, their target columns, and the associated source queries. It would be very helpful if you could share the same for this PBI as well.
