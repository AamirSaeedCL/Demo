Hi Team,

I am currently in the middle of testing the **account incremental pipeline** and have observed a performance issue that I would like to highlight.

During the latest run, the **core data movement steps** (Copy from **DM → STG** and **STG → DBO**) completed in approximately **5 minutes**. However, the steps responsible for **disabling and re-enabling table constraints** took **over 30 minutes**, which is disproportionately high and has a significant impact on the overall pipeline execution time.

Given that this is an **incremental pipeline**, the cost of disabling and re-enabling constraints appears to outweigh any potential benefit. These operations are typically useful during **initial or full-load ingestions** to improve bulk load performance, but in an incremental scenario—where data volumes are relatively small and changes are limited—the benefit is minimal.

Additionally, repeatedly toggling constraints can:

* Introduce unnecessary blocking and locking on target tables
* Increase pipeline runtime and resource consumption
* Reduce overall reliability of frequent incremental executions

Based on the above, I would recommend **removing the constraint disable/enable steps from the incremental pipeline** and limiting their use to **initial ingestion or full refresh pipelines only**.

Please let me know your thoughts or if there are any specific downstream dependencies or data integrity considerations that would require these steps to remain in place.

Thanks.
