Pull Request Description
I have a quick suggestion regarding our agile process. Today, I worked on ticket #14508, which involved refactoring the POC worker service, and I have raised a pull request for it. I have also updated the ticket status accordingly. However, I noticed that our agile board does not include a "Review" session between the "In Progress" and "Development" stages. Typically, after development, we conduct a review session before proceeding to testing. Should we consider adding this review stage to our workflow to ensure thorough code evaluation and maintain consistency in our process?
