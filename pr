The query identifies which debtors have had any digital interaction since yesterday by consolidating data from multiple sources. It starts with the main account list from MarlinDW.dbo.account (#tableA), then fetches the latest digital e&I activity from MarlinDW..SFS_MASTER (#Digital_EI_CF), Salesforce interactions from DiallerOperation.dbo.Salesforce_Interactions_Master (#SF_CF), and Cube transactions from DiallerOperation.dbo.Cube_Transactions (#CubeDate_CF). These sources are joined and evaluated to flag debtors with recent digital contact (#Digital_Contact_Today), which is finally filtered to show only those with interactions today.



AMR – We are retrieving both daysTillStoredReviewDate and monthsSinceReviewSetDate from the crs5_oltp.dbo.UDEFREVIEW table. These columns are available in the SIT environment, as can be observed above. For your convenience and reference, the query used to fetch these columns has been attached. Kindly review it and let us know if any further clarification or assistance is required.

AMR – The DigitalContactToday field is available in the table, and its datatype is bit. It will be the responsibility of the Function App to retrieve these fields and populate them into the JSON file. @Ekanath Reddy Gaddam, you may provide further clarification or confirm the implementation details regarding this process.

AMR – Data Source Clarification: Not all data is retrieved from a single database. For instance, as mentioned above, the digitalContactToday column is populated using data from multiple sources, including MarlinDW.SFS_MASTER, DiallerOperation.dbo.Salesforce_Interactions_Master, and DiallerOperation.dbo.Cube_Transactions, among others. This ensures comprehensive coverage and accuracy by consolidating relevant information across these databases.
