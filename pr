I have created a new pipelines for both initial ingestion + incremental for CustomerTags and leave the exisiting pipliens CustomerTag untouched - However, I have de-associated the trigger from the CustomerTag pipeline as it is no longer needed and created a new trigger
"Pipeline_Scheduler_Realtime_CustomerTags_V2" for CustomerTags pipeline. We need to add this trigger in our triggers release and I will add it later tomorrow morniong.
