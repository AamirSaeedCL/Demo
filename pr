This pull request introduces unit tests for the DatabaseService, TimerService, and Worker classes in the worker service POC project. The tests cover various scenarios including construction validation, method behavior, and logging for these classes. Key updates include:

DatabaseServiceTests: Tests for DatabaseService focusing on constructor validation, query execution, and error handling.
TimerServiceTests: Tests for TimerService covering start, stop, and dispose functionalities, along with error logging.
WorkerTests: Tests for Worker that validate construction, asynchronous operations, and disposal, including error handling.



=============




Summary:
Create unit tests for the DatabaseService class to ensure it behaves correctly under various conditions.

Description:
Implement the following unit tests for the DatabaseService class:

Constructor with Null Logger: Verify that the DatabaseService constructor throws an ArgumentNullException when a null logger is provided.
Constructor with Null Config: Verify that the DatabaseService constructor throws an ArgumentNullException when a null configuration is provided.
ExecuteQueries with Successful Execution: Test that ExecuteQueries method logs the correct information when the execution is successful.
ExecuteQueries with Exception: Ensure that ExecuteQueries method logs an error message when an exception is thrown during query execution.
Acceptance Criteria:

All test cases must be successfully passing.
The logging behavior must be verified using a custom TestLogger to capture and assert log messages.
Details:

Use the TestLogger class to capture log messages.
Mock IDatabaseClient to simulate query execution.
Dependencies:

Ensure the DatabaseService class is properly integrated with logging and database client interfaces.
Task 2: Implement Unit Tests for TimerService
Summary:
Develop unit tests for the TimerService class to validate its timer functionalities and error handling.

Description:
Implement the following unit tests for the TimerService class:

Start with Callback Invocation: Test that the Start method invokes the callback after the specified due time.
Start with Error Logging: Verify that the Start method logs an error when the callback throws an exception.
Stop Timer: Ensure that the Stop method halts the timer, preventing callback invocations.
Dispose Timer: Confirm that the Dispose method properly disposes of the timer without exceptions.
Acceptance Criteria:

All tests must pass successfully.
The Start method should correctly handle callbacks and log errors as expected.
Details:

Use Mock to verify that the logger logs the correct error messages.
Ensure timer callbacks and disposal are tested within appropriate time constraints.
Dependencies:

Verify the TimerService implementation and its interaction with the logging framework.
Task 3: Implement Unit Tests for Worker
Summary:
Create unit tests for the Worker class to ensure it properly integrates with the DatabaseService and TimerService, and handles its lifecycle methods.

Description:
Implement the following unit tests for the Worker class:

Constructor with Null Parameters: Verify that the Worker constructor throws an ArgumentNullException when any of its parameters (logger, database service, timer service, config) are null.
StartAsync Method: Ensure the StartAsync method starts the timer service with the correct interval.
DoWork Method: Test that the DoWork method calls the ExecuteQueries method on DatabaseService.
StopAsync Method: Verify that StopAsync stops the timer service correctly.
Dispose Method: Ensure that Dispose disposes of the timer service and handles any exceptions by logging an error.
Acceptance Criteria:

All tests must be successfully passing.
The Worker class should correctly start, stop, and dispose of its services.
Exceptions during disposal should be logged properly.
Details:

Use Mock to verify interactions with IDatabaseService and ITimerService.
Implement Verify statements to check that method calls and logging are occurring as expected.
Dependencies:

Ensure that Worker class implementation is properly aligned with its dependencies.
