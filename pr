I have reviewed both pipelines—WritebackInteractionHistory and WritebackDialerFulfillment—in both the Development and Test environments. Upon thorough validation, I found that both pipelines are functioning as expected, with no issues observed in their execution.

However, upon reviewing the bug report and examining the error logs in the DataFactoryPipelineLog table for the specified date and time related to these pipelines, I discovered that the associated JSON files were missing the mandatory accountId field. This omission likely caused the reported issue.

Please ensure that the JSON files adhere to the correct schema format and include all required fields, especially accountId.

For your reference, I have attached:

Thank you
