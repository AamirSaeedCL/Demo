Hi Mark,

I wanted to inform you that the JSON schema for the entire structure, along with all variations of the separate files (matching the same quantity as those you created), has been updated. I have uploaded the new files, and before doing so, I ensured that versioning is enabled in the document library, so we won't lose any previous changes.

I'll be in the office on Monday morning, and as you're aware, we have a new team member joining us. I'll also be working to arrange a meeting with our team in India to gather more requirements for the project.
