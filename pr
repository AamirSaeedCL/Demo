Pass the ServiceBusClient as a dependency. Instead of creating a new ServiceBusClient in the method, inject it through the constructor.

Both ServiceBusClient and ServiceBusSender are disposable. Use await using to ensure proper disposal, especially in an async method i-e
await using var sender = _serviceBusClient.CreateSender(_serviceBusTopic);

Added specific exception handling for ServiceBusException and JsonSerializationException i-e catch (JsonSerializationException jsonEx)

Removed the Task<bool> to let exceptions be handled externally. i-e public async Task SendObjToServiceBusAsync<T>(T entity, int retryCount = 0)
