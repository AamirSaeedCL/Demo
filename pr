Acceptance Criteria

1 - Rename “PreferenceTypeCode” field

Given the Customer associated data items have been updated to incorporate the new changes

When I view the Customer table within the PegaDataMart

Then I will see the "PreferenceTypeCode" field has been renamed to "consumerPreference"

And this update will also be applied to the Customer.json as "consumerPreference"

And this update will also be applied to the Customer data model within Pega

 

2 – Rename “ValidPhoneNumber” field

Given the Customer associated data items have been updated to incorporate the new changes

When I view the Customer table within the PegaDataMart

Then I will see the "ValidPhoneNumber" field has been renamed to "isValidPhone"

And this update will also be applied to the Customer.json as "isValidPhone"

And this update will also be applied to the Customer data model within Pega

 

3 – Update bit data types to not allow for nulls

Given Customer associated data items where datatype = bit have been updated to not allow for nulls

When the Customer pipeline is run within the PegaDataMart (incremental or Initial)

Then the following fields will only return a 1 or 0:

isValidPhone
isValidEmail
isValidMobile
digitalContactToday
isDeleted
 

And if the data at source is null/empty

Then this will be converted to a 0 when syncing the data to the Customer table

And when the Customer.json is generated

Then any of the above fields = 1 will be converted to “True”

And any of the above fields = 0 will be converted to “False”

And this will be ingested into Pega accordingly
