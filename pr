Hi Team, I'm middle of testing the account pipeline and noticed the below issue. It seems that disabiling and enabling contrains in table is taking so long - as you can see the actual steps (Copy from DM to stg and stg to dbo) took only 5 mins - However, disabiling & enabiling contrains took more then 30 mins, which is too much as this is inceamental pipeline. These steps could be handy in initial ingestion but I think we should remove these steps from increamental pipeline as I can't see any benefits of them.  Any thoughs
