Extend it with professional english:

Sorry, but this is very confusing as PBI descrition is not clear - Can you please write down simply the how many new columns we should add in total and new column name (Source) and Target Columns along with their mapping query as in all previous PBI has an excel sheet where we have all the new column names and their target column with source query.
