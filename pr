I am unable to open a .NET project due to a version mismatch between the installed MSBuild and the required .NET SDK. The project uses .NET SDK version 6.0.428, which requires MSBuild version 17.0.1 or higher.

Currently, my environment does not meet this requirement, likely due to an older version of Visual Studio being installed.

Request:
Please install Visual Studio 2022 (version 17.0 or later) on my machine to ensure compatibility with the required SDK and MSBuild version.
